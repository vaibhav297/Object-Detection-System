# Object Detection System

An object detection model developed using TensorFlow to identify and classify three household items. The system includes a custom dataset of over 300 images, real-time recognition capabilities on mobile devices, and a user-friendly interface for labeling detected objects.

## Features

- Custom object detection model trained on a dataset of 300+ images.
- Real-time object recognition on mobile devices.
- User-friendly interface for labeling detected objects.
- Developed using TensorFlow.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vaibhav297/Object-Detection-System.git
   cd Object-Detection-System
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Unzip the images dataset:
   ```bash
   unzip images.zip
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Object_Detection_System_VaibhavSahastrabuddhe.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to train and evaluate the object detection model.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of over 300 images of three different household items, captured in various scenarios to ensure diversity. The images are stored in the `images.zip` file.

## Model Deployment

The trained model can be deployed on mobile devices for real-time object recognition. The system includes a user-friendly interface for labeling detected objects.
